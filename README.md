# Simon Says

A simple web-based Simon Says game where you have to watch the order in which the circles enlarge, and remeber it, to them later click them in the same order and it will keep track of your score! There is also a cheat mode, which can be activated by pressing '?'. This mode will show the sequence of circles you need to click in order, updating on each click. Additionally, you can press '+' to increase the number of circles and '-' to decrease it. 

The project was created with HTML and TypeScript. This project also showcases fun animations, which can be seen when the game is in different states. For example, pre game start animation, and post game win/lose animations, in addition to circles enlargement and shrinkage animations throughout the game, and their hover animations. 

This was done for the User Interfaces course at the University of Waterloo, taken in Fall 2023, taught by Daniel Vogel, who created the simplekit framework, and allowed us to utlilize it for this project.
